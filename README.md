This is a very simple ML model for classifying digits using the Naive Bayes Algorithm. The images for the digits have been sourced from the Digits dataset available in scikit learn library. The digits data set was split into a test and training set.

The classification is based using the GaussianNB algorithm also from Scikit Learn. 

The following are displayed:
1) The accuracy of this simple ML model which turns out to be 83.333
2) The mis-classified digits: the model mis-classified 75 out of a total of 450 digits
3) The confusion matrix and its visualisation using a heat map: this gives the number of each label inco9rrectly and correctly clasified. Thus for example, out of a total of 32 fours, 31 were correctly classified. 1 was incorrectly classified as a 7.
